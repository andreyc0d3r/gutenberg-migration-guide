# Post Type Supports

Covers the Post Type Support feature of the Post API.

## Overview

In the Classic Editor, it's possible to use `add_post_type_support()` to register support of various features to a given post type. For instance, the `'title'` feature adds a title to the editor, and the `'thumbnail'` feature adds UI for selecting a featured image.

## Gutenberg Equivalent

All functionality related to `add_post_type_support()` should work as expected in Gutenberg.
